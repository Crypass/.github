# Crypass

🔐 **Crypass** is a zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted password manager built for individuals and teams.  
Currently under active development — stay tuned and feel free to contribute!

## 🧠 What is Crypass?

Crypass ensures that **only the user** can access their encrypted data — even we (the developers) have no access.  
With built-in team support, vault management, audit logging, and fine-grained permissions, Crypass aims to be  
an all-in-one secure solution for modern password and credential management.
